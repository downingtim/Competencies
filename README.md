We examined 53 survey responses spanning 4 levels across each of the 19 competencies. We used R packages data.table v1.16.0, dplyr v1.1.4, ggplot2 v3.5.1, tidyr v1.3.1 and plotly v4.10.4 to process and visualise the survey data. Survey responses "Not Applicable" were recoded as zero. We modelled the career stages as a linear series to explore the extent to which these were linearly associated with the competencies' mean scores using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. We compared each competency's correlation pattern to the mean across all competencies to identify instances where the score exceeded the 95% confidence intervals of the mean trend. We quantified the correlations of each competency pair's scores across the levels. All correlation coefficient p values were Benjamini-Hochberg corrected. In addition, we performed principal components analysis (PCA) on the responses across the levels to explore the extent to which the competencies were correlated with one another.
