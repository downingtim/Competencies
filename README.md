We examined 53 survey responses spanning 4 levels across each of the 19 competencies. We used R packages dplyr v1.1.4, ggplot2 v3.5.1, tidyr v1.3.1 and plotly v4.10.4 to process and visualise the survey data. Survey responses "Not Applicable" were recoded as zero. We modelled the career stages as a linear series to explore the extent to which these were linearly correlated with the competencies' mean scores. The correlation coefficient p values were Benjamini-Hochberg corrected. We compared each competency's pattern to the mean across all competencies to identify instances where the score exceeded the 95% confidence intervals of the mean trend.
